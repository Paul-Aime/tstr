# --- cmake version to be used
cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.0 )

# --- project name
project( tstr )

# --- flags
# This section is to tell CMake which compiler and compiler
# version you wish to build your project with. If you donâ€™t
# set anything, it will pick the best fit on its own.

# --- files
# In this section we basically specify all the files and
# club then into sensible variable names like source,
# include, etc. It is just to ease things out, but if you
# wish you can totally skip this section and use the file
# names directly instead of the variables

# --- include
# This command is used to specify the path of the include
# directories that you want the compiler to look into while
# searching for header files while compiling your code.
# This will also include the header files from 3rd party
# libraries.
include_directories( ./include ./src ./libs/rtaudio-5.1.0 )

# --- target
# This is the part where we tell CMake the name of the
# output file, in our case we wish to name it as reverb.
# Whatever files names follow after that are basically your
# source files same way as you do while compiling them
# manually.
add_executable( reverb ./src/main.cpp )

# --- external libs
# This part is what we call linking in compilation terms.
# So what you have done is you have included the header 
# files of these 3rd party libraries and now you need to
# tell the compiler where exactly are these libraries
# located.
